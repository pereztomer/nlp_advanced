All is going well, but then we had a break half way through the game and someone else asks if they could be goalkeeper (pretty sure that's not what it's called, but I am no more educated about basketball now than I was then). I asked a few other teammates if that sounded okay to them and no-one seemed to mind, so I let the girl who asked be goalkeeper.

Apparently this girl wasn't very good at sport. I had no idea. Instead of any of my team mates telling me she was crap and I should assign someone else, over the course of 10 minutes they all just walked off the court and sat on the sidelines. I had no idea what was going on. I went over and asked why they were sitting down, and they were all pretty horrible to me.

After a few minutes of her running flat out, she tripped and fell, but managed to grab onto the handle on the machine just in time to stop herself being thrown off. Now she's stuck, clinging on to the bar, trying to get back to her feet, while the machine keeps going at a ridiculous speed. Before anyone could get to her to help, her pants caught on the tread. The machine ripped her pants off, and flung them across the room.

259,"A group of friends and I went to Six Flags over Texas one summer day. We're all 19-20 at the time.

We've been there for a few hours in the heat, and after finishing a greasy meal of theme park burgers and fries, we decide its a good idea to ride the Mr. Freeze, a large roller coaster that goes forward and then backwards.

While we're waiting in line, my friend, who we'll call Jason, says that the burger is not agreeing with his bowels, but that he thinks he can still go on the ride. Now, Jaspn is a pretty dramatic guy, and likes to joke around a lot.

Fast forward a couple of minutes, and we'on the ride. We reach the halfway point, where the coaster goes straight up and stops briefly. Jason, sitting next to me in the two seater car, looks over and yells ""I'm pooping!"" As we both laugh, the ride shoots off backwards to take us through the loops and twists again, the other direction.

We get off the ride, and Jason runs to a bathroom. When he comes out, we see the unmistakeable small brown stain on his shorts.

TL;DR: Jason literally shit himself on the Mr. Freeze.","a group of friends and i went to six flags over texas one summer day. we're all 19-20 at the time.we've been there for a few hours in the heat, and after finishing a greasy meal of theme park burgers and fries, we decide its a good idea to ride the mr. freeze, a large roller coaster that goes forward and then backwards.while we're waiting in line, my friend, who we'll call jason, says that the burger is not agreeing with his bowels, but that he thinks he can still go on the ride. now, jaspn is a pretty dramatic guy, and likes to joke around a lot.fast forward a couple of minutes, and we'on the ride. we reach the halfway point, where the coaster goes straight up and stops briefly. jason, sitting next to me in the two seater car, looks over and yells ""i'm pooping!"" as we both laugh, the ride shoots off backwards to take us through the loops and twists again, the other direction.we get off the ride, and jason runs to a bathroom. when he comes out, we see the unmistakeable small brown stain on his shorts.tl;dr: jason literally shit himself on the mr. freeze.",1,evaluation

Needless to say, I would swing by there during the shift to check on them, and get my daily dose of caffeine goodness. So, one evening I was in there drinking my cup of Colombian Supreme and chatting with the manager. Several people came in, and one of them was a lady that kept looking at me. I politely nodded to her and raised my cup as if to say “hello,” and that is when she said, “Cop in a doughnut shop! [HaHaHa] That is so funny!” It’s not like I haven’t heard that a thousand times. Without missing a beat, I said, “Yep! They have great coffee!” I left it at that. Suddenly, a man that was in line behind her shouted, “Judging by the size of her ass, they must have great doughnuts too!” O-M-G! She was so furious that she stormed out of the door, leaving behind her doughnuts. I made eye contact with the man, who just gave me a thumbs up. I kept on drinking my coffee without saying a word.
